# phpBB Inactive User Manager v 1.1.5

phpBB Inactive User Manager is an Extension for [phpBB 3.1/3.2/3.3](https://www.phpbb.com/)

## Description

phpBB Inactive User Manager will allow you to manage inactive users in your phpBB3 board.
The extension is in a very early stage but I will try to update as often as I can.
Please let me know your ideas and thoughts.

## Features:

EXT sends e-mail reminders to users that are inactive for a certain amount of time. If user will not wake up after the 3d reminder user will be enabled for (auto) purging. After 3 reminders the ext stops sending reminders to user and admin will be able to delete that user.
Also user can self delete his account (with or without the approval of the administrator)
